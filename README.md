In the latest Hunger Index Report India was categorised with severity of hunger as serious.While the rate of undernourishment in India stood at 16.6 percent and under-five mortality at 3.1 percent, the prevalence of anaemia in women aged between 15 and 24 years stood at 58.1 percent. Though this report has been rejected by GOI , child unnourishment and ignorance of food nutrional values and proper diet planning of pregant women is still widely prevailing in our country. Thus we came up with Feed India project to solve this crisis.
